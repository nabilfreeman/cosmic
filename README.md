# i love you :heart:
making long distance a little easier

# why?

I made this for my girlfriend. She lives in China, I live in the UK. Also, because!

Tap the heart on the page, and a ripple is transmitted to everybody else on that page. When they respond, you see their ripple too.

You can test it out here. Thanks to the Red Hat Openshift free tier, the nodejs part of this app is hosted online!

Try out a private room, by going to https://legacy.freeman.sh/i-love-you#room123. Thanks to @gotbadger for implementing this feature!

# installation

    npm install
    port=8123 npm run start

Note the `port` variable. Set this to whatever you like.

Then, at the bottom of `./site/index.html` adjust the port number & remove/modify the Google Analytics snippet.

Do the same thing at the bottom of `./site/main.js`.

... Then direct your web server at the `./site` directory and have fun!

NB: The front end is not served through the corresponding nodejs application in this repo.

# releasing
In `Gruntfile.js` edit the `s3:{}` task to specify your AWS bucket region & name. You can also hardcode key and secret here but be careful with public repos.

Then, run this in your CLI:

    key=XXXXXX secret=XXXXXX npm run deploy

You can also make a `.env` file and store the variables in there. The file is ignored by git, so you don't have to fear pushing up keys.
